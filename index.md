Our mission is to democratize access to career advice for high-need learners. We do this in order to help them create professional goals and understand their personal paths to those goals. CareerVillage.org enables people to get that advice by giving them access to professionals as well as other career development tools, so we created guidelines to help community members contribute in an inclusive way. 

To ensure what’s posted on CareerVillage meets these guidelines, every piece of content is looked at and moderated by a real volunteer. We also offer coaching to our community members to make their advice even more outstanding.


**What you can expect to see in our guidelines:**
- [CareerVillage.org community members](http://guide.careervillage.org/#careervillageorg-community-members)-who they are and why they exist 
- [Community team](http://guide.careervillage.org/#careervillageorg-community-team)-who they are and what they do

## CareerVillage.org Community Members
*You can see the full description of each user type in our [Terms of Service](https://www.careervillage.org/terms/).*

**Learners**  
Learners are advice seekers, typically between the age of 13-24, and have not yet entered the workforce. While our main focus is youth, particularly underserved youth, we support all learners, such as returning citizens, career transitioners, and seasoned professionals, regardless of age or work experience. 

**Professionals**  
Professionals give Learners advice. They are most typically out of school and in the workforce, but we also have college students who give advice to younger peers. Sometimes, professionals are employees of companies who have formed a partnership with us (click [here]([https://www.careervillage.org/partners/](https://www.careervillage.org/partnerships/employee-engagement/?next=)) to read more about our corporate partnerships). 


 
**Educators**  
Educators are our career readiness champions, who incorporate CareerVillage into their curriculums to get Students to
the platform. 

## CareerVillage.org Community Team 
Our community team enforces our guidelines. 
 
**Moderators (a.k.a “Mods”)**  
Mods are CareerVillage users-turned-volunteers who commit to (collectively) looking at every piece of content that’s 
posted on CareerVillage.org. Their role is to ensure the community is following our guidelines. Typically, mods do not 
take direct corrective action. 
 
**Administrators (a.k.a “Admins”)**  
Admins are CareerVillage.org staff members, contractors, or other team members who support Mods in ensuring content on CareerVillage meets our Community Guidelines and take action on the actual moderation and coaching of content on the site. These actions include things like editing small portions of advice, deleting advice, leaving comments to help coach Professionals on giving more meaningful advice, and emailing users. 
 
**You**  
If you want, you can also be a member of our community team. We enable, encourage, and expect community members to get 
involved with the moderation of content on CareerVillage. When you see something that doesn’t meet our guidelines, please 
flag it using the buttons on the site or email us at [hello@careervillage.org](mailto:hello@careervillage.org) if you see 
something that doesn’t look right.  
 
## What is not allowed
We do not tolerate any form of disrespectful or degrading behavior on CareerVillage, and we moderate for content that is not inclusive of the greater community. In addition, we also moderate for content that distracts the community from what they’re here to do. Subjects and behaviors we never allow on CareerVillage are outlined below:


- **Bullying**
- **Hate speech**  
   Includes, *but is not limited to*, content that directly attacks people based on their:
    - Race
    - Ethnicity
    - Socioeconomic status
    - National origin
    - Religious affiliation
    - Sexual orientation
    - Gender, gender identity, or gender expression
    - Disabilities or diseases (visible or non-visible)
    - Other identities they hold
- **Illegal activity**
- **Sexually explicit content (e.g. pornography)**
- **Trolling**
- **Profanity**
-  **Recruiting, promoting, or persuading to follow a particular religious belief, or promote a political idea or alignment**
- **Personal contact information**  
    To respect the safety and privacy of our community members, we do not allow community members to post their phone number, email
	address, or home address. Learners are also only able to publicize their first name and the first initial of their last name.
- **Attempts to organize communications outside of our community**  
    For safety reasons, this includes directly inviting people to contact you, follow you, or connect with you outside of CareerVillage.org. (**Exception: Professionals can share links to their LinkedIn in their About Me sections. If there are other links/social media handles that pertain to your profession, please contact us at [hello@careervillage.org](mailto:hello@careervillage.org) if before posting it in your About Me**)
- **Spam**
  This includes accounts that are created on behalf of businesses or whose sole purpose is to promote a product or service. If we identify a spam account, it will be suspended immediately.  
- **Profile photo(s) that are off topic**  
    We define “off-topic” in this context as any image that does not have you in it and/or is not relevant to your profession.
- **Medical Advice**
 
## Do’s and Don’ts
**For Learners**  
**Do’s**
- Word your questions clearly.
- Give your question context that clearly states why an answer to that question will help you be better prepared for your future. Any question can be a career question with the right context! We have found that questions with more context tend to get answered with longer, more personalized pieces of advice from more people and more quickly than questions with very little context.
- What context should you give? It might be helpful to include grade level, subject interests, current major, or anything else that might help a Professional give you advice.
- Ask one question at a time. Questions are free – you can ask as many as you want! Asking more than one question can overwhelm Professionals, and they may not answer all of them,
- Post original questions. ProTip: Search first, ask second. The fastest way to get an answer is to read it on another question that is the same as yours! You may be prevented from asking a previously existing question. 
- Ask any direct follow-up questions about advice as a comment on that piece of advice
- Show your appreciation and say thank you to Professionals who leave you advice! Not only does this show your gratitude, but it's a great professional skill to develop. 


**Don’ts**
- Post off-topic content. We define “off-topic” as any content that isn’t relevant to your education, career, professional development, or planning for your future professional success.
	- If you are looking for advice on an “off-topic” question, please send us an email, 		and we can connect you with the right resource. 
	- Looking for mental health support? Check out [this chatbot](https://r.kokocares.org/careervillage/)! KokoCares connects users to different resources to help support their mental health needs.
- Ask for a job, internship, donation, or other form of gift or opportunity.
- Ask about your homework if you’re only asking to get the assignment done or if your questions about your homework don’t actually pertain to your career or future.


**For professionals**  
**Do’s**
- Follow our list of ProTips. To ensure Students are getting the best advice on CareerVillage, we’ve created a list of 8 ProTips 
  to support Professionals in giving the best advice possible. Click [here](https://www.careervillage.org/articles/uncategorized/pro-tips-for-stellar-advice/) for detailed information and examples of each Pro Tip.
  1. Be inclusive and avoid bias
  2. Be direct
  3. Anticipate needs 
  4. Tell a personal story that is relevant and relatable 
  5. Recommend next steps that are accessible for all learners 
  6. Use facts, cite sources, and avoid plagiarism 
  7. Strike the right tone 
  8. Make your answer easy to read
- Follow our AI Policy outlined below
- Refer questions you cannot answer to people in your network you know can. This will help expand the occupations and industries represented on CareerVillage.
- Give another Professional kudos for an answer you think is great by giving that piece of advice an upvote. This will signal quality advice to learners and will boost their answer and place it higher up on the Q&A page, where it will get even more reads.
- Include your job title, the company you work for, and/or the industry you work in your Headline. This increases accountability, transparency, and authority on the subject matter.
- Include information about your education, job (past and present), work history, hobbies, or any other information you think would be helpful for Learners to know about you in the “About me” section of your profile. Our learners want to know more about your background and how you got to where you are today!


**Don'ts**
- Post off-topic content. We define “off-topic” as any content that doesn’t directly answer or isn’t apparently relevant to the request for advice or the topic being discussed.
- Be discouraging of Learners’ aspirations or plans.
- Provide misleading information about yourself or purposely about the subject matter you’re discussing.
- Post ONLY a link and say, “Go find the answer over [there].” This includes things like “Google XYZ”. It is also unhelpful to suggest that a Learner ask their parents or a guidance counselor. 
- Self-promote.
- Directly offer employment or money to Learners. You can, however, direct Learners to an employment page (if you work for the company you’re referring the Learner to, you need to explicitly say that).
- Answer a question if you don’t have an answer or anything of value to contribute. You don’t have to answer every question that gets sent to you!
- Use our referral feature to harass people.
- Post a comment on another piece of advice that you want to add to. Post what you have to say as a separate answer instead!
- Include your personal mantra or philosophy (e.g., “Try harder every day!”) in your Headline.
- Leave your Headline or “About me” section in your profile blank!
- Upload a profile photo where we can’t see your face clearly (e.g. photos taken from too far away, blurry images, or a photo of a big group of people where we can’t see your face).
- Plagiarize. Remember to cite the sources you reference in your advice!
- Solely use AI to answer the question. Learners want to hear from you about your lived experience, not from a chatbot. Note: Advice given by AI will not receive volunteer credit. Using our AI answer-enhancing is completely okay as it does not write the advice. Please refer to our AI policy listed further below.
- Critique a Learner’s grammar or spelling. We are an international organization, and not everyone is a native English speaker.

## AI Policy

**Introduction**

This policy outlines the guidelines for using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate answers for Learners in the CareerVillage community.

*We allow the use of artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool to help generate insightful answers, improve original content, and contribute to community learning. However, it is important to use AI responsibly and adhere to the content guidelines. By following these guidelines, you can help to cultivate an environment that fosters authentic connections and builds a sense of community for everyone. Please note that the advice you post is yours, and you should stand by it.*

**Definitions**
- AI-generated content: Content that has been written or created entirely by an AI system.
- Human-in-the-loop content: A piece of content that has been written or created with the assistance of an AI system but has been reviewed and edited by a human before being submitted. This includes CareerVillage's AI-based features.
  
**Policy**
1. All AI-generated content must be disclosed as such. This means that the Professional must clearly indicate that the submission was written by an AI system. This can be as simple as “P.S. I used ChatGPT to get this answer.” We ask that users do this if more than 50% of their answer has come from an AI service.
2. AI-generated content must meet the same Community Guidelines standards as human-written content. This means that they must be well-written, informative, and relevant to the community.
3. All AI-generated content should be checked for accuracy and relevancy. AI is an evolving technology, but there are still limitations that can introduce errors, outdated information, and biases. AI-generated answers should be checked for alignment with current industry standards and practices and reviewed for any biases. 
4. Human-in-the-loop submissions do not need a disclosure but must provide information relevant to the topic and comply with all Community Guideline standards regarding content.
5. To maintain the authenticity and support generated by the community, we encourage Human-in-the-loop submissions that are personalized and convey an overall tone of support and encouragement to the learner. 
6. The advice you post is your advice, and you should stand by every word in that advice, regardless of whether or how you used AI during its composition."
   
Content that violates this policy may be deleted or coached if necessary. 

Note: This policy is subject to change as AI technology continues to evolve. We understand that AI is new and ever-changing, which means we are still learning how it works. We will review and update the policy regularly to ensure that it evolves alongside new AI advancements. If we flag your content for violating the AI policy when, in reality, you didn’t use AI at all, please let us know! This will help us inform any future policy changes and better serve our community. Any revisions to the policy will be reflected here.


## What we do when content doesn’t meet our guidelines

Much of the content that violates the guidelines outlined above gets blocked by default before it even gets posted. On the rare occasion 
that inappropriate content doesn’t automatically get caught, we take immediate action to rectify the situation. When our Community team believes content can be improved or it doesn’t meet the guidelines outlined here, they’ll take action to coach them to make it better. 

Depending on the content and its intent, we will do one or more of the following things:
- Remove it from the platform. 
- Contact community member(s) involved by email to request they take action or notify them of an action that was taken (e.g., “we’d like you
  to make a change to your content..”).
- Edit or make a change to the content. If we directly edit or change the content in any way we will always note clearly that an admin made a 
  change and explain why.
- Comment on it (the rest of the community can see this!) to inform the community members involved of an action that was taken or to request 
  they take an action. 
- Suspend community member(s). 

**Exceptions:** If there is a reason to make an exception to the guideline, or if something is flagged as inappropriate but does not meet any guideline outlined here, then Admins will discuss and come to a decision on how to address the issue.
